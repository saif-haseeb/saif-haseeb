# Saif's Portfolio

This site was build with React and acts as a bridge for all my projects. You'll find a highlight of my projects and experience, as well as anything I am
currently working on.

## Setup and building the site locally

A `dockerfile` is provided that will install dependencies required. 

1. Clone this repo
2. To build the image locally, run: `docker build -t saif-haseeb .`
3. To start the local server from container, run: `docker run -p 3000:3000 saif-haseeb`
(this will start the site at http://localhost:3000/)

## Contributing

There is no need to contribute as this is just a personal project for fun, but if you're keen then feel free to raise issues or PR's. Contact me to have a feature branch tied to CI set up, if you need it.
